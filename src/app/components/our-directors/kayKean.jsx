                        Kay has worked in the NHS for her whole career. Accepting redundancy from NHS England in 2014 Kay decided to look for her dream job as a Practice Manager. Her first job was at Alvanley Family Practice where she developed a collaborative practice model to work with volunteers and the local community to add capacity and improve health outcomes.                      
                    </p>

                    <p className="mt-5">
                        Kay now works at Urban Village Medical Practice in Ancoats, Manchester.  It is a unique practice having a standard contract, but also a contract to provide health care to the cityâ€™s homeless community.  The practice works closely with statutory and voluntary bodies, community interest companies and those experiencing homelessness to improve health outcomes.
